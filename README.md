# API-Demo-Postman
Using the "Postman" supertool, I played the 4 main API CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete);
If you want to learn by playing or you want to deepen the use of the "Postman" tool, you can do the following steps:
1.  Install "Postman" on your computer;
2.  Download the Demo.postman_collection.json API document from this repository to your computer and then using the "Import" option in "Postman", import it;
3.  Read the API documentation from the file simple-books-api.md and observe my examples from the previous step;
4.  Play alone and learn!;
5.  Look for other examples to learn and share them with the community;
